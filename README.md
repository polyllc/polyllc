### professional C++ googler
not really, but I enjoy using a variety of languages and frameworks including
- JavaScript (including HTML, CSS)
- C++
- Svelte
- Java
- PHP (if only)

There is nothing specific I work on, I just have ideas and maybe they'll one day they'll be finished

look around! maybe there is something that you're interested in, or maybe you like looking at bad code

as for projects I recommend looking at, maybe look at my latest C++ tester, or my ill updated auto-repository installer scrypty?

I am always more than willing to collaborate on projects, so don't hesitate to take my code and contribute and collaborate, or send me something that I can contribute to!
